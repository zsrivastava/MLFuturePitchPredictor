# MLFuturePitchPredictor
Runs four different machine learning models to guess the next pitch a pitcher will throw in a given situation.

There are many different approaches that go into predicting what type of pitch a pitcher will throw during a baseball game. From the great people at Baseball Savant, I was able to fetch data from three pitchers who have won the Cy Young Award in their careers: Shane Bieber, Jacob DeGrom, and Dallas Keuchel. The datasets that were used contain each pitch that they threw during the shortened 2020 Major League Baseball Season. Using knowledge of Python, and the packages that it contains, I was able to break down the dataset, add columns, and make predictions using a decision tree, neural network, random forest, and gradient boosting tree. This was a classification problem, and the goal was to make a logical prediction as to what type of pitch will be thrown, using the dataset and the result of the previous pitches as inputs. 

Credit to Baseball Savant for making it very easy to fetch pitch-by-pitch data, and download it as a csv: https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search?hfPT=FT%7C&hfAB=&hfGT=R%7C&hfPR=&hfZ=&stadium=&hfBBL=&hfNewZones=&hfPull=&hfC=&hfSea=2020%7C&hfSit=&player_type=pitcher&hfOuts=&opponent=&pitcher_throws=&batter_stands=&hfSA=&game_date_gt=&game_date_lt=&hfInfield=&team=&position=&hfOutfield=&hfRO=&home_road=&hfFlag=&hfBBT=&metric_1=&hfInn=&min_pitches=0&min_results=0&group_by=name&sort_col=pitches&player_event_sort=api_p_release_speed&sort_order=desc&min_pas=0#results
